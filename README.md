FLUXNET  SYNTHESIS	DATASET	- TECHNICAL	RELEASE
DATA	USE	POLICY
August	2015
http://technical-release.fluxdata.org/2015
In	the	context	of	the	FLUXNET	synthesis	dataset	under	preparation	it	has	been	decided	to	give	access	to	all	
the	potential	users	to	a	“technical	release”	in	order	to	allow	the	evaluation	of	the	products	under	
preparation	and	receive	feedback about	variables,	structure,	formats,	errors,	inconsistencies etc. The	data	
have	been	provided	by	the	site	PIs	and	processed	by	the	FLUXNET	synthesis	team.
Important	notes:
- The	data	are	not	in	the	final	format	(more	formats	will	be	available)	and	some	of	the	variables	
could	be	removed	if	users	feedback supports	this
- The	processing	codes	used	are	still	under	evaluation and	development	and	for	this	reason	the	data	
in	the	final	version	is	likely to change.	In	addition	it	is	possible	that	some	of	the	data	are	still	
affected	by	errors
- For	this	reason	the	objective	of	the	technical	release	is	only	a	formal	evaluation	of	the	data	and	not	
their	use	for	scientific	activities.	The	users	of	the	technical	release	should	be	ready	to	use	the	beta	
release	and	following	releases	and	can	have	an	influence	in	the	data	preparation	suggesting	
changes,	improvements,	clarifications	etc.
- The	data	owners are	always	the	site	PIs	and	for	this	reason	they	can	decide	to	use	the	data	as	they	
prefer	or	consider	valid	uses.
- Due	to	the	data	evaluation	objective	and	the	temporary	stage	of	the	products,	the	data	access	
should	happen	only	through	the	official	website,	in	order	to	keep	track	of	all	the	potential	users	
and	collect	feedback
For	the	reasons	listed	above,	by	downloading	and	using	these	data	you	agree	to:
- Not	redistribute	them	in	any	form	but	point	colleagues	and	other	users	to	the	official	website
- Not	use	this	version	of	the	data	for	scientific	activities	unless	planned,	discussed	and	approved	
with/by	the	site	owners	(PIs)
- Notify	the	FLUXNET	synthesis	team	about	all	the	data	uses
- Provide	feedback to	the	FLUXNET	Synthesis	Team	about	your	experience	with	the	data	and	which	
are	the	variables	that	you	think	are	more	useful	(and	if	you	want	also	the	less	useful)
Timeline	for	the	official	releases	(for	scientific	uses)
The	beta-release,	available	for	scientific	activities,	will	be made	available in	December	2015	and	two	
addendum	releases	will	be	also	made	available	in	April	and	July	2016.	The	final	version	of	the	FLUXNET	
synthesis	dataset	(with	all	data	reprocessed)	will	be	released	in	December	2016
For	comments	and	contacts, please	write	to	technical-release@fluxdata.org, preferably	by	end	of	October	
2015.
